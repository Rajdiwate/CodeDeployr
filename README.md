# TODO

    1. provide the env variables to the frontend (how does vercel provide the env? buildtime or runtime? Do it store it without hashing it?)
    2. real time logs
    3. deployment status realtime
    4. try to cache node modules to prevent reinstalling them on every build

     Give user a retry button on the projects modal to retry the deployment when the deployment has failed or if there are no deployments started yet.
     Create an api for that which will check if theere is already a deployment that is in progress and if not the initiate a new one.

    1. Remove console logs
